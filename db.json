I'm typping it manually for now, until I discover how to do it, I got a function where I can see the date especifically even when I can just see the clock of my PC but well, that was for the sake of programming some stuff meanwhile.

To summarize I change all the blog to a JavaScript plain with HTML and CSS page, I'm not using React anymore for this blog for now, I have a lot to learn yet from JavaScript so do I.",

In that case I'm pretty sure that I'll install Deepin distro, I've been looking for distros that are aesthetic and I really like that one.\n",

Maybe do a Home page before entering the blog per s√©.\nI want to make this a real blog for my personal use, so what I should do is to make some research in how to keep the database of all this posts that I'm writing in here (if that can be free, better.)",

Furthermore I'll need to think in the logical part to add some functionalities to the blog, with a Home Page and a limit of post to show there, maybe a filter, that by the way I was dealing with a really toft one the last week or so, so I think I should do it as soon as possible.",
